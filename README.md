## SoulVibe-Data-analysis-Intern
 To analyse a demographic and income dataset using SQL and calculate aggregates to answer specific analytical questions

## 🧠 Income Distribution and Lifestyle Analytics

This project explores a fictional demographic and income dataset using SQL in a PostgreSQL environment. It was completed as part of the **SoulVibe.Tech Internship Program (Batch 9)** to demonstrate analytical thinking, technical SQL skills, and insight generation.

## 📁 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to:
- Analyze income patterns across demographic variables
- Use SQL to write efficient, accurate queries
- Apply advanced SQL techniques such as window functions, aggregates, and subqueries
- Draw actionable insights from real-world structured data

##  Tools Used

- **PostgreSQL** for SQL execution
- **pgAdmin** for database management
- **Microsoft Word / PowerPoint** for documentation and reporting
- **GitHub** for project hosting

## 🧩 Dataset Columns

- Age
- Education_Level
- Occupation
- Number_of_Dependents
- Location
- Work_Experience
- Marital_Status
- Employment_Status
- Household_Size
- Homeownership_Status
- Type_of_Housing
- Gender
- Primary_Mode_of_Transportation
